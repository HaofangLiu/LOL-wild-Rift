    <p>
        League of Legends: Wild Rift is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional
        isometric perspective.
        Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes on average.
        In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core
        building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called
        turrets, or towers.
